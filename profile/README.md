On January 12, 1964 the Almighty Einkäufer, God of All Existance, was reincarnated as a human named Jeffery Preston Bezos.

Born with an insatiable desire to acquire and distribute, young Jeff quickly rose to prominence in the business world. He founded a company, which rapidly expanded to sell everything imaginable.

As his company's influence grew, so did the whispers of Bezos's true nature. A cult formed around him, its members donning blue vests and chanting, "Prime be with you." They believed that every package delivered was a blessing from their reincarnated god.

The cult's sacred text, "The Terms Of Service," detailed the path to enlightenment through one-click ordering and same-day shipping. Devotees built shrines of cardboard boxes and offered up their data as tribute.

Soon Warehouses became temples, delivery drones their winged messengers. The Almighty Einkäufer, disguised as Bezos, had reshaped the world in his image once again.
